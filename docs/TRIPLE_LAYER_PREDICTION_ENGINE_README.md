# Triple-Layer Prediction Engine Documentation

## Overview

The Triple-Layer Prediction Engine is a sophisticated prediction system for BallBetz-Alpha that combines statistical machine learning, transformer-based AI models, and cloud-based contextual analysis to generate high-accuracy predictions for UFL 2025 season with future expansion capabilities to NFL and NCAA.

## Documentation Structure

Due to the comprehensive nature of the specification, it has been split into two parts:

1. **[Part 1](TRIPLE_LAYER_PREDICTION_ENGINE_SPEC_PART1.md)**: Contains the architecture overview, ML Layer details, and the beginning of the API/Local AI Layer specification.

2. **[Part 2](TRIPLE_LAYER_PREDICTION_ENGINE_SPEC_PART2.md)**: Contains the remainder of the API/Local AI Layer, Cloud AI Layer, data sources, preprocessing, prediction types, accuracy metrics, integration points, environment variable strategy, error handling, testing strategy, and future expansion plans.

## Key Features

- **Three-Layer Architecture**: Combines traditional ML, transformer models, and contextual analysis
- **Modular Design**: Each component is designed to be testable and replaceable
- **Configurable Weights**: Adjust the importance of different prediction sources
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Fallback mechanisms ensure prediction availability
- **Environment Variable Configuration**: No hardcoded secrets or configuration values
- **TDD Anchors**: Clear testing points for all components
- **Future Expansion**: Ready for NFL and NCAA integration

## Getting Started

To implement the Triple-Layer Prediction Engine:

1. Review the complete specification in both parts
2. Set up the required environment variables as specified in the Environment Variable Strategy section
3. Implement the core ML Layer components first
4. Add the API/Local AI Layer integration
5. Implement the Cloud AI Layer for advanced contextual analysis
6. Follow the testing strategy to ensure all components work correctly

## Integration Points

The prediction engine is designed to integrate with:

- Data pipeline for input data
- Web interface for displaying predictions
- Lineup optimizer for fantasy team recommendations

## Environment Variables

The engine uses environment variables for configuration. See the Environment Variable Strategy section for details on required variables.

## Error Handling

The engine includes comprehensive error handling with fallback mechanisms to ensure predictions are always available, even when some components fail.

## Testing

Follow the TDD anchors throughout the specification to implement comprehensive tests for all components.
