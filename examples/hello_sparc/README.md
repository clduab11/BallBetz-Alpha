# Hello SPARC

This is a simple "Hello World" application that demonstrates how to use the SPARC methodology workflow in practice.

## Overview

This example shows how to:

1. Start with SPARC Orchestrator mode
2. Break down the task into subtasks for specialized modes
3. Implement a modular, secure application
4. Test, document, and integrate the components

## Project Structure

- `config.py` - Configuration with environment variable handling
- `app.py` - Main application entry point 
- `utils/` - Utility functions
- `tests/` - Test files using pytest
- `docs/` - Project documentation

## Running the Example

```bash
python examples/hello_sparc/app.py
```

## SPARC Methodology Process

This project was created following the SPARC methodology:

1. **Specification & Pseudocode**: Defined requirements and created pseudocode
2. **Architecture**: Designed modular structure with clear boundaries
3. **Code Implementation**: Created modular code with proper configuration
4. **Testing**: Implemented tests following TDD principles
5. **Security Review**: Ensured no hardcoded secrets
6. **Documentation**: Created clear, concise documentation
7. **Integration**: Integrated all components into a cohesive application

## SPARC Best Practices Demonstrated

- ✅ All files under 500 lines
- ✅ No hardcoded environment variables
- ✅ Modular, testable design
- ✅ Clear documentation
- ✅ Proper error handling
