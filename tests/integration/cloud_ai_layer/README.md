# Cloud AI Layer Integration Tests

## Overview

This directory contains integration tests for the Cloud AI Layer, focusing on validating the interactions between different components and layers of the prediction engine.

## Test Scenarios

### Multi-Layer Prediction Integration
- End-to-end prediction generation
- Cross-layer data integration
- Weighted prediction combination

### Error Handling and Fallback
- Graceful handling of prediction source failures
- Fallback prediction generation mechanisms

### Prediction Explainability
- Generation of detailed prediction explanations
- Verification of source contributions and weights

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pytest
- All project dependencies installed

### Execution

```bash
# Run all Cloud AI Layer integration tests
pytest tests/integration/cloud_ai_layer/

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v tests/integration/cloud_ai_layer/

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=cloud_ai_layer tests/integration/cloud_ai_layer/
```

## Test Components

1. **Multi-Layer Prediction Test**
   - Validates prediction generation from:
     * Machine Learning Layer
     * API/AI Layer
     * External Factors
   - Checks weighted combination logic

2. **Error Handling Test**
   - Simulates partial or complete failures in prediction sources
   - Verifies fallback mechanisms
   - Ensures system resilience

3. **Explainability Test**
   - Generates comprehensive prediction explanations
   - Validates source contribution breakdown
   - Checks confidence scoring mechanism

## Best Practices

- All tests follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern
- Comprehensive error case coverage
- Mocking of external dependencies where appropriate
- Performance-conscious test design

## Continuous Integration

These integration tests are part of the project's CI/CD pipeline to ensure the reliability and consistency of the Cloud AI Layer's cross-component interactions.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check environment variables in `.env` files
- Verify network connectivity for external API calls
- Review logs for detailed error information

## Contributing

When adding new tests:
1. Follow existing test structure
2. Cover both successful and failure scenarios
3. Keep tests focused and modular
4. Update this README with new test descriptions
